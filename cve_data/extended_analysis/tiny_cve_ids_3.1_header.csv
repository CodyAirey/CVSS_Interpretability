CVE-2024-23639,Micronaut Framework is a modern  JVM-based  full stack Java framework designed for building modular  easily testable JVM applications with support for Java  Kotlin and the Groovy language. Enabled but unsecured management endpoints are susceptible to drive-by localhost attacks. While not typical of a production application  these attacks may have more impact on a development environment where such endpoints may be flipped on without much thought. A malicious/compromised website can make HTTP requests to `localhost`. Normally  such requests would trigger a CORS preflight check which would prevent the request; however  some requests are "simple" and do not require a preflight check. These endpoints  if enabled and not secured  are vulnerable to being triggered. Production environments typically disable unused endpoints and secure/restrict access to needed endpoints. A more likely victim is the developer in their local development host  who has enabled endpoints without security for the sake of easing development. This issue has been addressed in version 3.8.3. Users are advised to upgrade.,LOCAL,LOW,LOW,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH
CVE-2024-24819,icingaweb2-module-incubator is a working project of bleeding edge Icinga Web 2 libraries. In affected versions the class `gipfl\Web\Form` is the base for various concrete form implementations [1] and provides protection against cross site request forgery (CSRF) by default. This is done by automatically adding an element with a CSRF token to any form  unless explicitly disabled  but even if enabled  the CSRF token (sent during a client's submission of a form relying on it) is not validated. This enables attackers to perform changes on behalf of a user which  unknowingly  interacts with a prepared link or website. The version 0.22.0 is available to remedy this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,REQUIRED,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH
