CVE-2024-23639,Micronaut Framework is a modern  JVM-based  full stack Java framework designed for building modular  easily testable JVM applications with support for Java  Kotlin and the Groovy language. Enabled but unsecured management endpoints are susceptible to drive-by localhost attacks. While not typical of a production application  these attacks may have more impact on a development environment where such endpoints may be flipped on without much thought. A malicious/compromised website can make HTTP requests to `localhost`. Normally  such requests would trigger a CORS preflight check which would prevent the request; however  some requests are "simple" and do not require a preflight check. These endpoints  if enabled and not secured  are vulnerable to being triggered. Production environments typically disable unused endpoints and secure/restrict access to needed endpoints. A more likely victim is the developer in their local development host  who has enabled endpoints without security for the sake of easing development. This issue has been addressed in version 3.8.3. Users are advised to upgrade.,LOCAL,LOW,LOW,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH
CVE-2024-24819,icingaweb2-module-incubator is a working project of bleeding edge Icinga Web 2 libraries. In affected versions the class `gipfl\Web\Form` is the base for various concrete form implementations [1] and provides protection against cross site request forgery (CSRF) by default. This is done by automatically adding an element with a CSRF token to any form  unless explicitly disabled  but even if enabled  the CSRF token (sent during a client's submission of a form relying on it) is not validated. This enables attackers to perform changes on behalf of a user which  unknowingly  interacts with a prepared link or website. The version 0.22.0 is available to remedy this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,REQUIRED,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

An attacker who has access to the same local system has the ability to replace the genuine executables in the shared directory with malicious executables of the same name. A user may then run the malicious executable without realising it has been modified. This package is deprecated. Therefore  there will not be a patch provided for this vulnerability. To check if your executable build by pkg depends on native code and is vulnerable  run the executable and check if `/tmp/pkg/` was created. Users should transition to actively maintained alternatives. We would recommend investigating Node.js 21’s support for single executable applications. Given the decision to deprecate the pkg package  there are no official workarounds or remediations provided by our team. Users should prioritize migrating to other packages that offer similar functionality with enhanced security.,LOCAL,LOW,LOW,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

CVE-2023-6516,To keep its cache database efficient  `named` running as a recursive resolver occasionally attempts to clean up the database. It uses several methods  including some that are asynchronous: a small chunk of memory pointing to the cache element that can be cleaned up is first allocated and then queued for later processing. It was discovered that if the resolver is continuously processing query patterns triggering this type of cache-database maintenance  `named` may not be able to handle the cleanup events in a timely manner. This in turn enables the list of queued cleanup events to grow infinitely large over time  allowing the configured `max-cache-size` limit to be significantly exceeded.This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.45 and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,NONE,NONE,HIGH

CVE-2024-24814,mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified™ authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. In affected versions missing input validation on mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value makes the server vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. An internal security audit has been conducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer  like 99999999  the server struggles with the request for a long time and finally gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused our server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would make the server work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crash with minimal effort. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,NONE,NONE,HIGH

CVE-2024-25121,TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. In affected versions of TYPO3 entities of the File Abstraction Layer (FAL) could be persisted directly via `DataHandler`. This allowed attackers to reference files in the fallback storage directly and retrieve their file names and contents. The fallback storage ("zero-storage") is used as a backward compatibility layer for files located outside properly configured file storages and within the public web root directory. Exploiting this vulnerability requires a valid backend user account. Users are advised to update to TYPO3 version 8.7.57 ELTS  9.5.46 ELTS  10.4.43 ELTS  11.5.35 LTS  12.4.11 LTS  or 13.0.1 which fix the problem described. When persisting entities of the File Abstraction Layer directly via DataHandler  `sys_file` entities are now denied by default  and `sys_file_reference` & `sys_file_metadata` entities are not permitted to reference files in the fallback storage anymore. When importing data from secure origins  this must be explicitly enabled in the corresponding DataHandler instance by using `$dataHandler->isImporting = true;`.,NETWORK,LOW,LOW,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,LOW,NONE

If this plugin was configured to send requests to a bare host with no path (e.g.  https://www.example.com/ https://www.example.com/` )  requests to an endpoint other than the one configured by the administrator could be triggered by a specially crafted request from any user  resulting in an SSRF vector.

CVE-2023-5123,The JSON datasource plugin ( https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-json-datasource/ https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-json-datasource/ ) is a Grafana Labs maintained plugin for Grafana that allows for retrieving and processing JSON data from a remote endpoint (including a specific sub-path) configured by an administrator. Due to inadequate sanitization of the dashboard-supplied path parameter  it was possible to include path traversal characters (../) in the path parameter and send requests to paths on the configured endpoint outside the configured sub-path.                                         This means that if the datasource was configured by an administrator to point at some sub-path of a domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/some_safe_api/ https://example.com/api/some_safe_api/ )  it was possible for an editor to create a dashboard referencing the datasource which issues queries containing path traversal characters  which would in turn cause the datasource to instead query arbitrary subpaths on the configured domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/admin_api/) https://example.com/api/admin_api/) .In the rare case that this plugin is configured by an administrator to point back at the Grafana instance itself  this vulnerability becomes considerably more severe  as an administrator browsing a maliciously configured panel could be compelled to make requests to Grafana administrative API endpoints with their credentials  resulting in the potential for privilege escalation  hence the high score for this vulnerability.,NETWORK,LOW,LOW,REQUIRED,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

CVE-2023-48229,Contiki-NG is an open-source  cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. An out-of-bounds write exists in the driver for IEEE 802.15.4 radios on nRF platforms in the Contiki-NG operating system. The problem is triggered when parsing radio frames in the `read_frame` function in the `arch/cpu/nrf/net/nrf-ieee-driver-arch.c` module. More specifically  the `read_frame` function performs an incomplete validation of the payload length of the packet  which is a value that can be set by an external party that sends radio packets to a Contiki-NG system. Although the value is validated to be in the range of the MTU length  it is not validated to fit into the given buffer into which the packet will be copied. The problem has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG and is expected to be included in subsequent releases. Users are advised to update their develop branch or to update to a subsequent release when available. Users unable to upgrade should consider manually applying the changes in PR #2741.,NETWORK,HIGH,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,LOW,LOW,HIGH
CVE-2023-50926,Contiki-NG is an open-source  cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. An out-of-bounds read can be caused by an incoming DIO message when using the RPL-Lite implementation in the Contiki-NG operating system. More specifically  the prefix information of the DIO message contains a field that specifies the length of an IPv6 address prefix. The value of this field is not validated  which means that an attacker can set a value that is longer than the maximum prefix length. Subsequently  a memcmp function call that compares different prefixes can be called with a length argument that surpasses the boundary of the array allocated for the prefix  causing an out-of-bounds read. The problem has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG  and is expected to be included in the next release. Users are advised to update as soon as they are able to or to manually apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2721.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,NONE,NONE,HIGH

This problem allows a remote client or a remote server to perform Denial of Service when sending oversized headers in HTTP messages. In versions of Squid prior to 6.5 this can be achieved if the request_header_max_size or reply_header_max_size settings are unchanged from the default. In Squid version 6.5 and later  the default setting of these parameters is safe. Squid will emit a critical warning in cache.log if the administrator is setting these parameters to unsafe values.

CVE-2024-25618,Mastodon is a free  open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Mastodon allows new identities from configured authentication providers (CAS  SAML  OIDC) to attach to existing local users with the same e-mail address. This results in a possible account takeover if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address or multiple authentication providers are configured. When a user logs in through an external authentication provider for the first time  Mastodon checks the e-mail address passed by the provider to find an existing account. However  using the e-mail address alone means that if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address of an account  the Mastodon account can immediately be hijacked. All users logging in through external authentication providers are affected. The severity is medium  as it also requires the external authentication provider to misbehave. However  some well-known OIDC providers (like Microsoft Azure) make it very easy to accidentally allow unverified e-mail changes. Moreover  OpenID Connect also allows dynamic client registration. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.2.6  4.1.14  4.0.14  and 3.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,NETWORK,HIGH,NONE,REQUIRED,UNCHANGED,LOW,LOW,NONE
CVE-2024-25619,Mastodon is a free  open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. When an OAuth Application is destroyed  the streaming server wasn't being informed that the Access Tokens had also been destroyed  this could have posed security risks to users by allowing an application to continue listening to streaming after the application had been destroyed. Essentially this comes down to the fact that when Doorkeeper sets up the relationship between Applications and Access Tokens  it uses a `dependent: delete_all` configuration  which means the `after_commit` callback setup on `AccessTokenExtension` didn't actually fire  since `delete_all` doesn't trigger ActiveRecord callbacks. To mitigate  we need to add a `before_destroy` callback to `ApplicationExtension` which announces to streaming that all the Application's Access Tokens are being "killed". Impact should be negligible given the affected application had to be owned by the user. None the less this issue has been addressed in versions 4.2.6  4.1.14  4.0.14  and 3.5.18.

CVE-2024-25123,MSS (Mission Support System) is an open source package designed for planning atmospheric research flights. In file: `index.py`  there is a method that is vulnerable to path manipulation attack. By modifying file paths  an attacker can acquire sensitive information from different resources.

CVE-2024-25625,Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore. A potential security vulnerability has been discovered in `pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle` prior to version 1.3.4. The vulnerability involves a Host Header Injection in the `invitationLinkAction` function of the UserController  specifically in the way `$loginUrl` trusts user input.  The host header from incoming HTTP requests is used unsafely when generating URLs. An attacker can manipulate the HTTP host header in requests to the /admin/user/invitationlink endpoint  resulting in the generation of URLs with the attacker's domain. In fact  if a host header is injected in the POST request  the $loginURL parameter is constructed with this unvalidated host header. It is then used to send an invitation email to the provided user. This vulnerability can be used to perform phishing attacks by making the URLs in the invitation links emails point to an attacker-controlled domain. Version 1.3.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability. The maintainers recommend validating the host header and ensuring it matches the application's domain. It would also be beneficial to use a default trusted host or hostname if the incoming host header is not recognized or is absent.,NETWORK,LOW,HIGH,REQUIRED,CHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,NONE

CVE-2024-1635,A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This vulnerability impacts a server that supports the wildfly-http-client protocol. Whenever a malicious user opens and closes a connection with the HTTP port of the server and then closes the connection immediately  the server will end with both memory and open file limits exhausted at some point  depending on the amount of memory available. At HTTP upgrade to remoting  the WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit leaks connections if RemotingConnection is closed by Remoting ServerConnectionOpenListener. Because the remoting connection originates in Undertow as part of the HTTP upgrade  there is an external layer to the remoting connection. This connection is unaware of the outermost layer when closing the connection during the connection opening procedure. Hence  the Undertow WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit is not notified of the closed connection in this scenario. Because WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit creates a timeout task  the whole dependency tree leaks via that task  which is added to XNIO WorkerThread. So  the workerThread points to the Undertow conduit  which contains the connections and causes the leak.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,NONE,NONE,HIGH

Starting in version 0.4.rc3 and prior to version 2.0.9 of the `devise_invitable` gem  the invites feature allows users to accept the invitation for an unlimited amount of time through the password reset functionality. This issue creates vulnerable dependencies starting in version 0.0.1.alpha3 and prior to versions 0.26.9  0.27.5  and 0.28.0 of the `decidim ` `decidim-admin`  and `decidim-system` gems.

The only check done is if the user has been invited but the code does not ensure that the pending invitation is still valid as defined by the `invite_for` expiry period. Decidim sets this configuration to `2.weeks` so this configuration should be respected.

CVE-2023-51447,Decidim is a participatory democracy framework. Starting in version 0.27.0 and prior to versions 0.27.5 and 0.28.0  the dynamic file upload feature is subject to potential cross-site scripting attacks in case the attacker manages to modify the file names of the records being uploaded to the server. This appears in sections where the user controls the file upload dialogs themselves and has the technical knowledge to change the file names through the dynamic upload endpoint. Therefore I believe it would require the attacker to control the whole session of the particular user but in any case  this needs to be fixed. Successful exploit of this vulnerability would require the user to have successfully uploaded a file blob to the server with a malicious file name and then have the possibility to direct the other user to the edit page of the record where the attachment is attached. The users are able to craft the direct upload requests themselves controlling the file name that gets stored to the database. The attacker is able to change the filename e.g. to `<svg onload=alert('XSS')>` if they know how to craft these requests themselves. And then enter the returned blob ID to the form inputs manually by modifying the edit page source. Versions 0.27.5 and 0.28.0 contain a patch for this issue.

CVE-2024-25129,The CodeQL CLI repo holds binaries for the CodeQL command line interface (CLI). Prior to version 2.16.3  an XML parser used by the CodeQL CLI to read various auxiliary files is vulnerable to an XML External Entity attack. If a vulnerable version of the CLI is used to process either a maliciously modified CodeQL database  or a specially prepared set of QL query sources  the CLI can be made to make an outgoing HTTP request to an URL that contains material read from a local file chosen by the attacker. This may result in a loss of privacy of exfiltration of secrets. Security researchers and QL authors who receive databases or QL source files from untrusted sources may be impacted. A single untrusted `.ql` or `.qll` file cannot be affected  but a zip archive or tarball containing QL sources may unpack auxiliary files that will trigger an attack when CodeQL sees them in the file system. Those using CodeQL for routine analysis of source trees with a preselected set of trusted queries are not affected. In particular  extracting XML files from a source tree into the CodeQL database does not make one vulnerable. The problem is fixed in release 2.16.3 of the CodeQL CLI. Other than upgrading  workarounds include not accepting CodeQL databases or queries from untrusted sources  or only processing such material on a machine without an Internet connection. Customers who use older releases of CodeQL for security scanning in an automated CI system and cannot upgrade for compliance reasons can continue using that version. That use case is safe. If such customers have a private query pack and use the `codeql pack create` command to precompile them before using them in the CI system  they should be using the production CodeQL release to run `codeql pack create`. That command is safe as long as the QL source it precompiled is trusted. All other development of the query pack should use an upgraded CLI.,LOCAL,HIGH,NONE,REQUIRED,CHANGED,LOW,NONE,NONE

CVE-2022-21658,Rust is a multi-paradigm  general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety  especially safe concurrency. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `std::fs::remove_dir_all` standard library function is vulnerable a race condition enabling symlink following (CWE-363). An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise access or delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following build targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack  and are thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS before version 10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1 as soon as possible  especially people developing programs expected to run in privileged contexts (including system daemons and setuid binaries)  as those have the highest risk of being affected by this. Note that adding checks in your codebase before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate the vulnerability  as they would also be vulnerable to race conditions like remove_dir_all itself. The existing mitigation is working as intended outside of race conditions.,LOCAL,HIGH,LOW,NONE,UNCHANGED,NONE,HIGH,HIGH

CVE-2021-43799,Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. Zulip Server installs RabbitMQ for internal message passing. In versions of Zulip Server prior to 4.9  the initial installation (until first reboot  or restart of RabbitMQ) does not successfully limit the default ports which RabbitMQ opens; this includes port 25672  the RabbitMQ distribution port  which is used as a management port. RabbitMQ's default "cookie" which protects this port is generated using a weak PRNG  which limits the entropy of the password to at most 36 bits; in practicality  the seed for the randomizer is biased  resulting in approximately 20 bits of entropy. If other firewalls (at the OS or network level) do not protect port 25672  a remote attacker can brute-force the 20 bits of entropy in the "cookie" and leverage it for arbitrary execution of code as the rabbitmq user. They can also read all data which is sent through RabbitMQ  which includes all message traffic sent by users. Version 4.9 contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround  ensure that firewalls prevent access to ports 5672 and 25672 from outside the Zulip server.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

CVE-2021-41766,Apache Karaf allows monitoring of applications and the Java runtime by using the Java Management Extensions (JMX). JMX is a Java RMI based technology that relies on Java serialized objects for client server communication. Whereas the default JMX implementation is hardened against unauthenticated deserialization attacks  the implementation used by Apache Karaf is not protected against this kind of attack. The impact of Java deserialization vulnerabilities strongly depends on the classes that are available within the targets class path. Generally speaking  deserialization of untrusted data does always represent a high security risk and should be prevented. The risk is low as  by default  Karaf uses a limited set of classes in the JMX server class path. It depends of system scoped classes (e.g. jar in the lib folder).,NETWORK,HIGH,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

CVE-2021-4160,There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure. Many EC algorithms are affected  including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail  because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However  for an attack on TLS to be meaningful  the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients  which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.

CVE-2022-23607,treq is an HTTP library inspired by requests but written on top of Twisted's Agents. Treq's request methods (`treq.get`  `treq.post`  etc.) and `treq.client.HTTPClient` constructor accept cookies as a dictionary.

This can potentially cause sensitive information to leak upon an HTTP redirect to a different domain.  e.g. should `https://example.com` redirect to `http://cloudstorageprovider.com` the latter will receive the cookie `session`. Treq 2021.1.0 and later bind cookies given to request methods (`treq.request`  `treq.get`  `HTTPClient.request`  `HTTPClient.get`  etc.) to the origin of the *url* parameter.

CVE-2022-23597,Element Desktop is a Matrix client for desktop platforms with Element Web at its core.

CVE-2022-23601,Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. The Symfony form component provides a CSRF protection mechanism by using a random token injected in the form and using the session to store and control the token submitted by the user. When using the FrameworkBundle  this protection can be enabled or disabled with the configuration. If the configuration is not specified  by default  the mechanism is enabled as long as the session is enabled. In a recent change in the way the configuration is loaded  the default behavior has been dropped and  as a result  the CSRF protection is not enabled in form when not explicitly enabled  which makes the application sensible to CSRF attacks. This issue has been resolved in the patch versions listed and users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,REQUIRED,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

Negative dimensions are allowed in some cases to mimic Python's negative indexing (i.e.  indexing from the end of the array)  however if the value is too negative then the implementation of `Dim` would access elements before the start of an array.

CVE-2022-21731,Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of shape inference for `ConcatV2` can be used to trigger a denial of service attack via a segfault caused by a type confusion. The `axis` argument is translated into `concat_dim` in the `ConcatShapeHelper` helper function. Then  a value for `min_rank` is computed based on `concat_dim`. This is then used to validate that the `values` tensor has at least the required rank. However  `WithRankAtLeast` receives the lower bound as a 64-bits value and then compares it against the maximum 32-bits integer value that could be represented. Due to the fact that `min_rank` is a 32-bits value and the value of `axis`  the `rank` argument is a negative value  so the error check is bypassed. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.

CVE-2021-32732,### Impact It's possible to know if a user has or not an account in a wiki related to an email address  and which username(s) is actually tied to that email by forging a request to the Forgot username page.

CVE-2022-23583,Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that any binary op would trigger `CHECK` failures. This occurs when the protobuf part corresponding to the tensor arguments is modified such that the `dtype` no longer matches the `dtype` expected by the op. In that case  calling the templated binary operator for the binary op would receive corrupted data  due to the type confusion involved. If `Tin` and `Tout` don't match the type of data in `out` and `input_*` tensors then `flat<*>` would interpret it wrongly.

CVE-2022-23600,fleet is an open source device management  built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet  _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP  but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely  this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use  Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet  and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP  delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.,NETWORK,LOW,LOW,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,NONE,NONE

CVE-2022-23627,ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code  introduced in version V5.2.2.2  the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular  a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`  to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured  being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances.

CVE-2023-37273,Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. Running Auto-GPT version prior to 0.4.3 by cloning the git repo and executing `docker compose run auto-gpt` in the repo root uses a different docker-compose.yml file from the one suggested in the official docker set up instructions. The docker-compose.yml file located in the repo root mounts itself into the docker container without write protection. This means that if malicious custom python code is executed via the `execute_python_file` and `execute_python_code` commands  it can overwrite the docker-compose.yml file and abuse it to gain control of the host system the next time Auto-GPT is started. The issue has been patched in version 0.4.3.,LOCAL,LOW,LOW,NONE,CHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH
CVE-2023-37274,Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. When Auto-GPT is executed directly on the host system via the provided run.sh or run.bat files  custom Python code execution is sandboxed using a temporary dedicated docker container which should not have access to any files outside of the Auto-GPT workspace directory.Before v0.4.3  the `execute_python_code` command (introduced in v0.4.1) does not sanitize the `basename` arg before writing LLM-supplied code to a file with an LLM-supplied name. This allows for a path traversal attack that can overwrite any .py file outside the workspace directory by specifying a `basename` such as `../../../main.py`. This can further be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution on the host running Auto-GPT by e.g. overwriting autogpt/main.py which will be executed outside of the docker environment meant to sandbox custom python code execution the next time Auto-GPT is started. The issue has been patched in version 0.4.3.

Before v0.4.3  it was possible for a malicious external resource (such as a website browsed by Auto-GPT) to cause misleading messages to be printed to the console by getting the LLM to regurgitate JSON encoded ANSI escape sequences (`\u001b[`).

CVE-2023-34236,Weave GitOps Terraform Controller (aka Weave TF-controller) is a controller for Flux to reconcile Terraform resources in a GitOps way. A vulnerability has been identified in Weave GitOps Terraform Controller which could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive information. This vulnerability stems from Weave GitOps Terraform Runners (`tf-runner`)  where sensitive data is inadvertently printed - potentially revealing sensitive user data in their pod logs. In particular  functions `tfexec.ShowPlan`  `tfexec.ShowPlanRaw`  and `tfexec.Output` are implicated when the `tfexec` object set its `Stdout` and `Stderr` to be `os.Stdout` and `os.Stderr`. An unauthorized remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing these prints of sensitive information  which may contain configurations or tokens that could be used to gain unauthorized control or access to resources managed by the Terraform controller. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to utilize this sensitive data  potentially leading to unauthorized access or control of the system. This vulnerability has been addressed in Weave GitOps Terraform Controller versions `v0.14.4` and `v0.15.0-rc.5`. Users are urged to upgrade to one of these versions to mitigate the vulnerability. As a temporary measure until the patch can be applied  users can add the environment variable `DISABLE_TF_LOGS` to the tf-runners via the runner pod template of the Terraform Custom Resource. This will prevent the logging of sensitive information and mitigate the risk of this vulnerability.,NETWORK,LOW,LOW,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,NONE,NONE

CVE-2023-37479,Open Enclave is a hardware-agnostic open source library for developing applications that utilize Hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments  also known as Enclaves. There are two issues that are mitigated in version 0.19.3. First  Open Enclave SDK does not properly sanitize the `MXCSR` register on enclave entry. This makes applications vulnerable to MXCSR Configuration Dependent Timing (MCDT) attacks  where incorrect `MXCSR` values can impact instruction retirement by at most one cycle  depending on the (secret) data operand value. Please find more details in the guidance from Intel in the references. Second  Open Enclave SDK does not sanitize x86's alignment check flag `RFLAGS.AC` on enclave entry. This opens up the possibility for a side-channel attacker to be notified for every unaligned memory access performed by the enclave. The issue has been addressed in version 0.19.3 and the current master branch. Users will need to recompile their applications against the patched libraries to be protected from this vulnerability.

CVE-2023-3446,Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check()  DH_check_ex()or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience longdelays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtainedfrom an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of thosechecks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to usea very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus whichis over 10 000 bits in length.However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parametersthat have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus valueeven if it has already been found to be too large.An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtainedfrom an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() andEVP_PKEY_param_check().Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applicationswhen using the '-check' option.The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,NONE,NONE,LOW

CVE-2023-37895,Java object deserialization issue in Jackrabbit webapp/standalone on all platforms allows attacker to remotely execute code via RMIVersions up to (including) 2.20.10 (stable branch) and 2.21.17 (unstable branch) use the component "commons-beanutils"  which contains a class that can be used for remote code execution over RMI.Users are advised to immediately update to versions 2.20.11 or 2.21.18. Note that earlier stable branches (1.0.x .. 2.18.x) have been EOLd already and do not receive updates anymore.In general  RMI support can expose vulnerabilities by the mere presence of an exploitable class on the classpath. Even if Jackrabbit itself does not contain any code known to be exploitable anymore  adding other components to your server can expose the same type of problem. We therefore recommend to disable RMI access altogether (see further below)  and will discuss deprecating RMI support in future Jackrabbit releases.How to check whether RMI support is enabledRMI support can be over an RMI-specific TCP port  and over an HTTP binding. Both are by default enabled in Jackrabbit webapp/standalone.The native RMI protocol by default uses port 1099. To check whether it is enabled  tools like "netstat" can be used to check.RMI-over-HTTP in Jackrabbit by default uses the path "/rmi". So when running standalone on port 8080  check whether an HTTP GET request on localhost:8080/rmi returns 404 (not enabled) or 200 (enabled). Note that the HTTP path may be different when the webapp is deployed in a container as non-root context  in which case the prefix is under the user's control.Turning off RMIFind web.xml (either in JAR/WAR file or in unpacked web application folder)  and remove the declaration and the mapping definition for the RemoteBindingServlet:        <servlet>            <servlet-name>RMI</servlet-name>            <servlet-class>org.apache.jackrabbit.servlet.remote.RemoteBindingServlet</servlet-class>        </servlet>        <servlet-mapping>            <servlet-name>RMI</servlet-name>            <url-pattern>/rmi</url-pattern>        </servlet-mapping>Find the bootstrap.properties file (in $REPOSITORY_HOME)  and set         rmi.enabled=false    and also remove         rmi.host         rmi.port         rmi.url-pattern If there is no file named bootstrap.properties in $REPOSITORY_HOME  it is located somewhere in the classpath.

CVE-2023-38488,Kirby is a content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.5.8.3  3.6.6.3  3.7.5.2  3.8.4.1  and 3.9.6 affects all Kirby sites that might have potential attackers in the group of authenticated Panel users or that allow external visitors to update a Kirby content file (e.g. via a contact or comment form). Kirby sites are *not* affected if they don't allow write access for untrusted users or visitors.A field injection in a content storage implementation is a type of vulnerability that allows attackers with content write access to overwrite content fields that the site developer didn't intend to be modified. In a Kirby site this can be used to alter site content  break site behavior or inject malicious data or code. The exact security risk depends on the field type and usage.Kirby stores content of the site  of pages  files and users in text files by default. The text files use Kirby's KirbyData format where each field is separated by newlines and a line with four dashes (`----`). When reading a KirbyData file  the affected code first removed the Unicode BOM sequence from the file contents and afterwards split the content into fields by the field separator.When writing to a KirbyData file  field separators in field data are escaped to prevent user input from interfering with the field structure. However this escaping could be tricked by including a Unicode BOM sequence in a field separator (e.g. `--\xEF\xBB\xBF--`). When writing  this was not detected as a separator  but because the BOM was removed during reading  it could be abused by attackers to inject other field data into content files.Because each field can only be defined once per content file  this vulnerability only affects fields in the content file that were defined above the vulnerable user-writable field or not at all. Fields that are defined below the vulnerable field override the injected field content and were therefore already protected.The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3  3.6.6.3  3.7.5.2  3.8.4.1  and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned releases  the maintainers have fixed the affected code to only remove the Unicode BOM sequence at the beginning of the file. This fixes this vulnerability both for newly written as well as for existing content files.,NETWORK,LOW,LOW,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH
CVE-2023-38489,Kirby is a content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.5.8.3  3.6.6.3  3.7.5.2  3.8.4.1  and 3.9.6 affects all Kirby sites with user accounts (unless Kirby's API and Panel are disabled in the config). It can only be abused if a Kirby user is logged in on a device or browser that is shared with potentially untrusted users or if an attacker already maliciously used a previous password to log in to a Kirby site as the affected user.Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization. In the variation described in this advisory  it allows attackers to stay logged in to a Kirby site on another device even if the logged in user has since changed their password. Kirby did not invalidate user sessions that were created with a password that was since changed by the user or by a site admin. If a user changed their password to lock out an attacker who was already in possession of the previous password or of a login session on another device or browser  the attacker would not be reliably prevented from accessing the Kirby site as the affected user.The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3  3.6.6.3  3.7.5.2  3.8.4.1  and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned releases  the maintainers have updated the authentication implementation to keep track of the hashed password in each active session. If the password changed since the login  the session is invalidated. To enforce this fix even if the vulnerability was previously abused  all users are logged out from the Kirby site after updating to one of the patched releases.,NETWORK,LOW,LOW,REQUIRED,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,NONE
CVE-2023-38490,Kirby is a content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.5.8.3  3.6.6.3  3.7.5.2  3.8.4.1  and 3.9.6 only affects Kirby sites that use the `Xml` data handler (e.g. `Data::decode($string  'xml')`) or the `Xml::parse()` method in site or plugin code. The Kirby core does not use any of the affected methods.XML External Entities (XXE) is a little used feature in the XML markup language that allows to include data from external files in an XML structure. If the name of the external file can be controlled by an attacker  this becomes a vulnerability that can be abused for various system impacts like the disclosure of internal or confidential data that is stored on the server (arbitrary file disclosure) or to perform network requests on behalf of the server (server-side request forgery  SSRF).Kirby's `Xml::parse()` method used PHP's `LIBXML_NOENT` constant  which enabled the processing of XML external entities during the parsing operation. The `Xml::parse()` method is used in the `Xml` data handler (e.g. `Data::decode($string  'xml')`). Both the vulnerable method and the data handler are not used in the Kirby core. However they may be used in site or plugin code  e.g. to parse RSS feeds or other XML files. If those files are of an external origin (e.g. uploaded by a user or retrieved from an external URL)  attackers may be able to include an external entity in the XML file that will then be processed in the parsing process. Kirby sites that don't use XML parsing in site or plugin code are *not* affected.The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3  3.6.6.3  3.7.5.2  3.8.4.1  and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned releases  the maintainers have removed the `LIBXML_NOENT` constant as processing of external entities is out of scope of the parsing logic. This protects all uses of the method against the described vulnerability.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,CHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,NONE

CVE-2023-38491,Kirby is a content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.5.8.3  3.6.6.3  3.7.5.2  3.8.4.1  and 3.9.6 affects all Kirby sites that might have potential attackers in the group of authenticated Panel users or that allow external visitors to upload an arbitrary file to the content folder. Kirby sites are not affected if they don't allow file uploads for untrusted users or visitors or if the file extensions of uploaded files are limited to a fixed safe list. The attack requires user interaction by another user or visitor and cannot be automated.An editor with write access to the Kirby Panel could upload a file with an unknown file extension like `.xyz` that contains HTML code including harmful content like `<script>` tags. The direct link to that file could be sent to other users or visitors of the site. If the victim opened that link in a browser where they are logged in to Kirby and the file had not been opened by anyone since the upload  Kirby would not be able to send the correct MIME content type  instead falling back to `text/html`. The browser would then run the script  which could for example trigger requests to Kirby's API with the permissions of the victim.The issue was caused by the underlying `Kirby\Http\Response::file()` method  which didn't have an explicit fallback if the MIME type could not be determined from the file extension. If you use this method in site or plugin code  these uses may be affected by the same vulnerability.The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3  3.6.6.3  3.7.5.2  3.8.4.1  and 3.9.6.

A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.5.8.3  3.6.6.3  3.7.5.2  3.8.4.1  and 3.9.6 affects all Kirby sites with user accounts (unless Kirby's API and Panel are disabled in the config). The real-world impact of this vulnerability is limited  however we still recommend to update to one of the patch releases because they also fix more severe vulnerabilities.Kirby's authentication endpoint did not limit the password length. This allowed attackers to provide a password with a length up to the server's maximum request body length. Validating that password against the user's actual password requires hashing the provided password  which requires more CPU and memory resources (and therefore processing time) the longer the provided password gets. This could be abused by an attacker to cause the website to become unresponsive or unavailable. Because Kirby comes with a built-in brute force protection  the impact of this vulnerability is limited to 10 failed logins from each IP address and 10 failed logins for each existing user per hour.The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3  3.6.6.3  3.7.5.2  3.8.4.1  and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned releases  the maintainers have added password length limits in the affected code so that passwords longer than 1000 bytes are immediately blocked  both when setting a password and when logging in.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,NONE,NONE,HIGH

CVE-2023-38505,DietPi-Dashboard is a web dashboard for the operating system DietPi. The dashboard only allows for one TLS handshake to be in process at a given moment. Once a TCP connection is established in HTTPS mode  it will assume that it should be waiting for a handshake  and will stay this way indefinitely until a handshake starts or some error occurs. In version 0.6.1  this can be exploited by simply not starting the handshake  preventing any other TLS handshakes from getting through. An attacker can lock the dashboard in a state where it is waiting for a TLS handshake from the attacker  who won't provide it. This prevents any legitimate traffic from getting to the dashboard  and can last indefinitely. Version 0.6.2 has a patch for this issue. As a workaround  do not use HTTPS mode on the open internet where anyone can connect. Instead  put a reverse proxy in front of the dashboard  and have it handle any HTTPS connections.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,NONE,NONE,HIGH

The core issue is that one of the supported data warehouses (an embedded in-memory database H2)  exposes a number of ways for a connection string to include code that is then executed by the process running the embedded database. Because Metabase allows users to connect to databases  this means that a user supplied string can be used to inject executable code. Metabase allows users to validate their connection string before adding a database (including on setup)  and this validation API was the primary vector used as it can be called without validation. Versions 0.43.7.3  0.44.7.3  0.45.4.3  0.46.6.4  1.43.7.3  1.44.7.3  1.45.4.3  and 1.46.6.4 fix this issue by removing the ability of users to add H2 databases entirely. As a workaround  it is possible to block these vulnerabilities at the network level by blocking the endpoints `POST /api/database`  `PUT /api/database/:id`  and `POST /api/setup/validateuntil`.

CVE-2023-37896,Nuclei is a vulnerability scanner. Prior to version 2.9.9  a security issue in the Nuclei project affected users utilizing Nuclei as Go code (SDK) running custom templates. This issue did not affect CLI users. The problem was related to sanitization issues with payload loading in sandbox mode. There was a potential risk with payloads loading in sandbox mode. The issue occurred due to relative paths not being converted to absolute paths before doing the check for `sandbox` flag allowing arbitrary files to be read on the filesystem in certain cases when using Nuclei from `Go` SDK implementation. This issue has been fixed in version 2.9.9. The maintainers have also enabled sandbox by default for filesystem loading. This can be optionally disabled if required. The `-sandbox` option has been deprecated and is now divided into two new options: `-lfa` (allow local file access) which is enabled by default and `-lna` (restrict local network access) which can be enabled by users optionally. The `-lfa` allows file (payload) access anywhere on the system (disabling sandbox effectively)  and `-lna` blocks connections to the local/private network.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,NONE,NONE
CVE-2023-38487,HedgeDoc is software for creating real-time collaborative markdown notes. Prior to version 1.9.9  the API of HedgeDoc 1 can be used to create notes with an alias matching the ID of existing notes. The affected existing note can then not be accessed anymore and is effectively hidden by the new one.When the freeURL feature is enabled (by setting the `allowFreeURL` config option or the `CMD_ALLOW_FREEURL` environment variable to `true`)  any user with the appropriate permissions can create a note by making a POST request to the `/new/<ALIAS>` API endpoint. The `<ALIAS>` parameter can be set to the ID of an existing note. HedgeDoc did not verify whether the provided `<ALIAS>` value corresponds to a valid ID of an existing note and always allowed creation of the new note. When a visitor tried to access the existing note  HedgeDoc will first search for a note with a matching alias before it searches using the ID  therefore only the new note can be accessed.Depending on the permission settings of the HedgeDoc instance  the issue can be exploited only by logged-in users or by all (including non-logged-in) users. The exploit requires knowledge of the ID of the target note. Attackers could use this issue to present a manipulated copy of the original note to the user  e.g. by replacing the links with malicious ones. Attackers can also use this issue to prevent access to the original note  causing a denial of service. No data is lost  as the original content of the affected notes is still present in the database.This issue was fixed in version 1.9.9. As a workaround  disabling freeURL mode prevents the exploitation of this issue. The impact can be limited by restricting freeURL note creation to trusted  logged-in users by enabling `requireFreeURLAuthentication`/`CMD_REQUIRE_FREEURL_AUTHENTICATION`.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,NONE,HIGH,LOW

Attackers with privileged access to the network can intercept room invitations and address confirmation emails. This is patched in Sydent 2.5.6. When patching  make sure that Sydent trusts the certificate of the server it is connecting to. This should happen automatically when using properly issued certificates. Those who use self-signed certificates should make sure to copy their Certification Authority certificate  or their self signed certificate if using only one  to the trust store of your operating system.

CVE-2023-38697,protocol-http1 provides a low-level implementation of the HTTP/1 protocol. RFC 9112 Section 7.1 defined the format of chunk size  chunk data and chunk extension. The value of Content-Length header should be a string of 0-9 digits  the chunk size should be a string of hex digits and should split from chunk data using CRLF  and the chunk extension shouldn't contain any invisible character. However  Falcon has following behaviors while disobey the corresponding RFCs: accepting Content-Length header values that have `+` prefix  accepting Content-Length header values that written in hexadecimal with `0x` prefix  accepting `0x` and `+` prefixed chunk size  and accepting LF in chunk extension. This behavior can lead to desync when forwarding through multiple HTTP parsers  potentially results in HTTP request smuggling and firewall bypassing. This issue is fixed in `protocol-http1` v0.15.1.

CVE-2023-38698,Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed  open  and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. According to the documentation  controllers are allowed to register new domains and extend the expiry of existing domains  but they cannot change the ownership or reduce the expiration time of existing domains. However  a preliminary analysis suggests that an attacker-controlled controller may be able to reduce the expiration time of existing domains due to an integer overflow in the renew function. The vulnerability resides `@ensdomains/ens-contracts` prior to version 0.0.22.If successfully exploited  this vulnerability would enable attackers to force the expiration of any ENS record  ultimately allowing them to claim the affected domains for themselves. Currently  it would require a malicious DAO to exploit it. Nevertheless  any vulnerability present in the controllers could potentially render this issue exploitable in the future. An additional concern is the possibility of renewal discounts. Should ENS decide to implement a system that offers unlimited .eth domains for a fixed fee in the future  the vulnerability could become exploitable by any user due to the reduced attack cost.Version 0.0.22 contains a patch for this issue. As long as registration cost remains linear or superlinear based on registration duration  or limited to a reasonable maximum (eg  1 million years)  this vulnerability could only be exploited by a malicious DAO. The interim workaround is thus to take no action.,NETWORK,LOW,LOW,NONE,UNCHANGED,NONE,HIGH,NONE

CVE-2023-39903,An issue was discovered in Fujitsu Software Infrastructure Manager (ISM) before 2.8.0.061. The ismsnap component (in this specific case at /var/log/fujitsu/ServerViewSuite/ism/FirmwareManagement/FirmwareManagement.log) allows insecure collection and storage of authorization credentials in cleartext. That occurs when users perform any ISM Firmware Repository Address setup test (Test the Connection)  or regularly authorize against an already configured remote firmware repository site  as set up in ISM Firmware Repository Address. A privileged attacker is therefore able to potentially gather the associated ismsnap maintenance data  in the same manner as a trusted party allowed to export ismsnap data from ISM. The preconditions for an ISM installation to be generally vulnerable are that the Download Firmware (Firmware Repository Server) function is enabled and configured  and that the character \ (backslash) is used in a user credential (i.e.  user/ID or password) of the remote proxy host / firmware repository server.

CVE-2023-39363,Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). In versions 0.2.15  0.2.16 and 0.3.0  named re-entrancy locks are allocated incorrectly. Each function using a named re-entrancy lock gets a unique lock regardless of the key  allowing cross-function re-entrancy in contracts compiled with the susceptible versions. A specific set of conditions is required to result in misbehavior of affected contracts  specifically: a `.vy` contract compiled with `vyper` versions `0.2.15`  `0.2.16`  or `0.3.0`; a primary function that utilizes the `@nonreentrant` decorator with a specific `key` and does not strictly follow the check-effects-interaction pattern (i.e. contains an external call to an untrusted party before storage updates); and a secondary function that utilizes the same `key` and would be affected by the improper state caused by the primary function.

Prior to version 1.4.2  it allows for remote code execution in cases where an application passes user-supplied input directly to the `import()` function. This vulnerability has been patched in import-in-the-middle version 1.4.2.Some workarounds are available. Do not pass any user-supplied input to `import()`. Instead  verify it against a set of allowed values. If using import-in-the-middle  directly or indirectly  and support for EcmaScript Modules is not needed  ensure that no options are set  either via command-line or the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable  that would enable loader hooks.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

CVE-2023-39523,ScanCode.io is a server to script and automate software composition analysis with ScanPipe pipelines. Prior to version 32.5.1  the software has a possible command injection vulnerability in the docker fetch process as it allows to append malicious commands in the `docker_reference` parameter.In the function `scanpipe/pipes/fetch.py:fetch_docker_image` the parameter `docker_reference` is user controllable. The `docker_reference` variable is then passed to the vulnerable function `get_docker_image_platform`.  However  the `get_docker_image_plaform` function constructs a shell command with the passed `docker_reference`. The `pipes.run_command` then executes the shell command without any prior sanitization  making the function vulnerable to command injections. A malicious user who is able to create or add inputs to a project can inject commands. Although the command injections are blind and the user will not receive direct feedback without logs  it is still possible to cause damage to the server/container. The vulnerability appears for example if a malicious user adds a semicolon after the input of `docker://;`  it would allow appending malicious commands.Version 32.5.1 contains a patch for this issue. The `docker_reference` input should be sanitized to avoid command injections and  as a workaround  one may avoid creating commands with user controlled input directly.,NETWORK,LOW,LOW,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

CVE-2023-39532,SES is a JavaScript environment that allows safe execution of arbitrary programs in Compartments. In version 0.18.0 prior to 0.18.7  0.17.0 prior to 0.17.1  0.16.0 prior to 0.16.1  0.15.0 prior to 0.15.24  0.14.0 prior to 0.14.5  an 0.13.0 prior to 0.13.5  there is a hole in the confinement of guest applications under SES that may manifest as either the ability to exfiltrate information or execute arbitrary code depending on the configuration and implementation of the surrounding host.Guest program running inside a Compartment with as few as no endowments can gain access to the surrounding host’s dynamic import by using dynamic import after the spread operator  like `{...import(arbitraryModuleSpecifier)}`.On the web or in web extensions  a Content-Security-Policy following ordinary best practices likely mitigates both the risk of exfiltration and execution of arbitrary code  at least limiting the modules that the attacker can import to those that are already part of the application. However  without a Content-Security-Policy  dynamic import can be used to issue HTTP requests for either communication through the URL or for the execution of code reachable from that origin.Within an XS worker  an attacker can use the host’s module system to the extent that the host has been configured. This typically only allows access to module code on the host’s file system and is of limited use to an attacker.Within Node.js  the attacker gains access to Node.js’s module system. Importing the powerful builtins is not useful except insofar as there are side-effects and tempered because dynamic import returns a promise. Spreading a promise into an object renders the promises useless. However  Node.js allows importing data URLs  so this is a clear path to arbitrary execution.Versions 0.18.7  0.17.1  0.16.1  0.15.24  0.14.5  and 0.13.5 contain a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. On the web  providing a suitably constrained Content-Security-Policy mitigates most of the threat. With XS  building a binary that lacks the ability to load modules at runtime mitigates the entirety of the threat. That will look like an implementation of `fxFindModule` in a file like `xsPlatform.c` that calls `fxRejectModuleFile`.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

CVE-2022-25217,Use of a hard-coded cryptographic key pair by the telnetd_startup service allows an attacker on the local area network to obtain a root shell on the device over telnet.

The remaining versions cited here redacted the private key  but left the public key unchanged. An attacker in possession of the leaked private key may  through a scripted exchange of UDP packets  instruct telnetd_startup to spawn an unauthenticated telnet shell as root  by means of which they can then obtain complete control of the device.

CVE-2021-41848,An issue was discovered in Luna Simo PPR1.180610.011/202001031830. It mishandles software updates such that local third-party apps can provide a spoofed software update file that contains an arbitrary shell script and arbitrary ARM binary  where both will be executed as the root user with an SELinux domain named osi. To exploit this vulnerability  a local third-party app needs to have write access to external storage to write the spoofed update at the expected path. The vulnerable system binary (i.e.  /system/bin/osi_bin) does not perform any authentication of the update file beyond ensuring that it is encrypted with an AES key (that is hard-coded in the vulnerable system binary). Processes executing with the osi SELinux domain can programmatically perform the following actions: install apps  grant runtime permissions to apps (including permissions with protection levels of dangerous and development)  access extensive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using the programmatically grant permissions  uninstall apps  set the default launcher app to a malicious launcher app that spoofs other apps  set a network proxy to intercept network traffic  unload kernel modules  set the default keyboard to a keyboard that has keylogging functionality  examine notification contents  send text messages  and more. The spoofed update can optionally contain an arbitrary ARM binary that will be locally stored in internal storage and executed at system startup to achieve persistent code execution as the root user with the osi SELinux domain.

CVE-2022-0778,The BN_mod_sqrt() function  which computes a modular square root  contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature  any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2  1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0 3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m).

CVE-2022-23610,wire-server provides back end services for Wire  an open source messenger. In versions of wire-server prior to the 2022-01-27 release  it was possible to craft DSA Signatures to bypass SAML SSO and impersonate any Wire user with SAML credentials. In teams with SAML  but without SCIM  it was possible to create new accounts with fake SAML credentials. Under certain conditions that can be established by an attacker  an upstream library for parsing  rendering  signing  and validating SAML XML data was accepting public keys as trusted that were provided by the attacker in the signature. As a consequence  the attacker could login as any user in any Wire team with SAML SSO enabled. If SCIM was not enabled  the attacker could also create new users with new SAML NameIDs. In order to exploit this vulnerability  the attacker needs to know the SSO login code (distributed to all team members with SAML credentials and visible in the Team Management app)  the SAML EntityID identifying the IdP (a URL not considered sensitive  but usually hard to guess  also visible in Team Management)  and the SAML NameID of the user (usually an email address or a nick). The issue has been fixed in wire-server `2022-01-27` and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On premise instances of wire-server need to be updated to `2022-01-27`  so that their backends are no longer affected. There are currently no known workarounds.

CVE-2022-24761,Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When using Waitress versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does not properly validate the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard  Waitress and the frontend proxy may disagree on where one request starts and where it ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to waitress and later behavior. There are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to request smuggling that are addressed by this advisory: The use of Python's `int()` to parse strings into integers  leading to `+10` to be parsed as `10`  or `0x01` to be parsed as `1`  where as the standard specifies that the string should contain only digits or hex digits; and Waitress does not support chunk extensions  however it was discarding them without validating that they did not contain illegal characters. This vulnerability has been patched in Waitress 2.1.1. A workaround is available. When deploying a proxy in front of waitress  turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this functionality though and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of waitress instead.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,NONE,HIGH,NONE

CVE-2021-46390,An access control issue in the authentication module of Lexar_F35 v1.0.34 allows attackers to access sensitive data and cause a Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker without access to securely protected data on a secure USB flash drive can bypass user authentication without having any information related to the password of the registered user. The secure USB flash drive transmits the password entered by the user to the authentication module in the drive after the user registers a password  and then the input password is compared with the registered password stored in the authentication module. Subsequently  the module returns the comparison result for the authentication decision. Therefore  an attacker can bypass password authentication by analyzing the functions that return the password verification or comparison results and manipulate the authentication result values. Accordingly  even if attackers enter an incorrect password  they can be authenticated as a legitimate user and can therefore exploit functions of the secure USB flash drive by manipulating the authentication result values.,PHYSICAL,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

Argo CD starting with version 1.3.0 but before versions 2.1.11  2.2.6  and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal bug  compounded by an improper access control bug  allowing a malicious user with read-only repository access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `get` access for a repository containing a Helm chart can craft an API request to the `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` endpoint to leak the contents of out-of-bounds files from the repo-server.

CVE-2022-24768,Argo CD is a declarative  GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with 1.0.0 are vulnerable to an improper access control bug  allowing a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level. Versions starting with 0.8.0 and 0.5.0 contain limited versions of this issue. To perform exploits  an authorized Argo CD user must have push access to an Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` and `override` access to an Application. Once a user has that access  different exploitation levels are possible depending on their other RBAC privileges. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.2  2.2.8  and 2.1.14. Some mitigation measures are available but do not serve as a substitute for upgrading. To avoid privilege escalation  limit who has push access to Application source repositories or `sync` + `override` access to Applications; and limit which repositories are available in projects where users have `update` access to Applications. To avoid unauthorized resource inspection/tampering  limit who has `delete`  `get`  or `action` access to Applications.,NETWORK,LOW,LOW,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

CVE-2022-24769,Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities  creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally  when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities  otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug  containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped  deleted  and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround  the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.,LOCAL,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,LOW,LOW,LOW

Only the first architecture in the list was tested  which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore  the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However  this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted.

CVE-2022-24791,Wasmtime is a standalone JIT-style runtime for WebAssembly  using Cranelift. There is a use after free vulnerability in Wasmtime when both running Wasm that uses externrefs and enabling epoch interruption in Wasmtime. If you are not explicitly enabling epoch interruption (it is disabled by default) then you are not affected. If you are explicitly disabling the Wasm reference types proposal (it is enabled by default) then you are also not affected. The use after free is caused by Cranelift failing to emit stack maps when there are safepoints inside cold blocks. Cold blocks occur when epoch interruption is enabled. Cold blocks are emitted at the end of compiled functions  and change the order blocks are emitted versus defined. This reordering accidentally caused Cranelift to skip emitting some stack maps because it expected to emit the stack maps in block definition order  rather than block emission order. When Wasmtime would eventually collect garbage  it would fail to find live references on the stack because of the missing stack maps  think that they were unreferenced garbage  and therefore reclaim them. Then after the collection ended  the Wasm code could use the reclaimed-too-early references  which is a use after free. Patches have been released in versions 0.34.2 and 0.35.2  which fix the vulnerability. All Wasmtime users are recommended to upgrade to these patched versions. If upgrading is not an option for you at this time  you can avoid the vulnerability by either: disabling the Wasm reference types proposal  config.wasm_reference_types(false); or by disabling epoch interruption if you were previously enabling it. config.epoch_interruption(false).,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

CVE-2022-24801,Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications  supporting Python 3.6+. Prior to version 22.4.0rc1  the Twisted Web HTTP 1.1 server  located in the `twisted.web.http` module  parsed several HTTP request constructs more leniently than permitted by RFC 7230. This non-conformant parsing can lead to desync if requests pass through multiple HTTP parsers  potentially resulting in HTTP request smuggling. Users who may be affected use Twisted Web's HTTP 1.1 server and/or proxy and also pass requests through a different HTTP server and/or proxy. The Twisted Web client is not affected. The HTTP 2.0 server uses a different parser  so it is not affected. The issue has been addressed in Twisted 22.4.0rc1.

CVE-2022-24795,yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data)  which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`  which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms  however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size  leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround  avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,NONE,NONE,HIGH

CVE-2022-41972,Contiki-NG is an open-source  cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. Versions prior to 4.9 contain a NULL Pointer Dereference in BLE L2CAP module. The Contiki-NG operating system for IoT devices contains a Bluetooth Low Energy stack. An attacker can inject a packet in this stack  which causes the implementation to dereference a NULL pointer and triggers undefined behavior. More specifically  while processing the L2CAP protocol  the implementation maps an incoming channel ID to its metadata structure. In this structure  state information regarding credits is managed through calls to the function input_l2cap_credit in the module os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c. Unfortunately  the input_l2cap_credit function does not check that the metadata corresponding to the user-supplied channel ID actually exists  which can lead to the channel variable being set to NULL before a pointer dereferencing operation is performed. The vulnerability has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG  and will be included in release 4.9.
